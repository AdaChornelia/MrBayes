README for web pages (gh-pages) http://nbisweden.github.io/MrBayes

It is a set of static pages.  Do not change the HTML documents in the
top directory, instead modify the source HTML templates in the "source"
directory and follow the instructions below to rebuild/update the main
website pages:

Create (or update after changing) them using

    $ make -C source            # alternatively: ( cd source && make )

Clean (remove) them with

    $ make -C source clean      # alternatively:  ( cd source && make clean )

After committing changes to the HTML files in the top directory (or any
of the assets), the changes will be live immediately or after a short
delay.
