This website is work in progress!

It is currently being moved over from its old home at SourceForge.

It is a set of static pages.  Do not change the HTML documents in the
top directory, instead modify the source HTML templates in the "source"
directory and follow the instructions below to rebuild/update the main
website pages:

Create (or update after changing) them using

    $ make -C build         # alternatively: ( cd build && make )

Clean (remove) them with

    $ make -C build clean   # alternatively:  ( cd build && make clean )

After committing changes to the HTML files in the top directory (or any
of the assets), the changes will be live immediately or after a short
delay.


TODO:

    * When the bugs in the SourceForge bug tracking database are
      migrated to GitHub issues, update issues links.

    * Mailing list, likewise.
