    <h2>Manual and Other Resources</h2>

    <h3>Manual</h3>

    <p>A good resource for new users is the MrBayes 3.2 manual, which
    contains instructions for downloading and installing the program,
    two tutorials including a quick-start version, discussions of all
    the models implemented in the program, answers to some frequently
    asked questions, and a list of the differences between versions 2
    and 3 of the program. In an appendix, there is a diagrammatic
    summary of all the models implemented in the program and most of
    the proposal mechanisms. You can download the manual (pdf) <a href=
    "https://github.com/NBISweden/MrBayes/blob/develop/doc/manual/Manual_MrBayes_v3.2.pdf">
    here</a>.</p>

    <h3>Online Help</h3>

    <p>MrBayes 3 provides extensive online help through the
    <kbd>help</kbd> command. Simply type <kbd>help</kbd> at the command
    prompt to get a list of the available commands. Type <kbd>help
    &lt;command&gt;</kbd> to get help information for a specific
    command. For instance, <kbd>help lset</kbd> will give you the help
    information for the <kbd>lset</kbd> command, including a discussion
    of all the available parameters and options. The help information
    for a command typically also includes a summary table of the
    options and current settings.</p>

    <h3>Command Reference</h3>

    <p>You can produce a text file containing all the help information
    for the current version of the program by using the
    <kbd>manual</kbd> command in MrBayes. If you produce this file
    immediately after starting the program, the text file will contain
    all the default settings and can be used as a command
    reference.</p>

    <h3>General Advice</h3>

    <p>Remember that MrBayes is free software and that it currently has
    thousands of users around the world. Therefore, the authors have no
    possibility to provide extensive user help. Please first read the
    manual and the command reference carefully to make sure the problem
    you are having is not addressed there. If the problem you are
    having seems to be a bug in the program, report it as described
    <a href="issues.html">here</a>.</p>
