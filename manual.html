<h2>Manual and Other Resources</h2>


<h3>Manual</h3>


<p>A good resource for new users is the MrBayes 3.2 manual, which
contains instructions for downloading and installing the program, two
tutorials including a quick-start version, discussions of all the
models implemented in the program, answers to some frequently asked
questions, and a list of the differences between versions 2 and 3 of
the program. In an appendix, there is a diagrammatic summary of all the
models implemented in the program and most of the proposal mechanisms.
You can download the manual (pdf) <a href=
"https://github.com/NBISweden/MrBayes/blob/develop/doc/manual/Manual_MrBayes_v3.2.pdf">
here</a>.</p>


<h3>Online Help</h3>


<p>MrBayes 3 provides extensive online help through the <kbd>help</kbd>
command. Simply type <kbd>help</kbd> at the command prompt to get a
list of the available commands. Type <kbd>help &lt;command&gt;</kbd> to
get help information for a specific command. For instance, <kbd>help
lset</kbd> will give you the help information for the <kbd>lset</kbd>
command, including a discussion of all the available parameters and
options. The help information for a command typically also includes a
summary table of the options and current settings.</p>


<h3>Command Reference</h3>


<p>You can produce a text file containing all the help information for
the current version of the program by using the <kbd>manual</kbd>
command in MrBayes. If you produce this file immediately after starting
the program, the text file will contain all the default settings and
can be used as a command reference.</p>


<h3>General Advice</h3>


<p>Remember that MrBayes is free software and that it currently has
thousands of users around the world. Therefore, the authors have no
possibility to provide extensive user help. Please first read the
manual and the command reference carefully to make sure the problem you
are having is not addressed there. If the problem you are having seems
to be a bug in the program, report it as described <a href=
"issues.html">here</a>.</p>


<h3>Citing MrBayes</h3>


<p>If you publish results obtained using MrBayes you may want to cite
the program using one of these papers:</p>


<ul>
<li>Huelsenbeck, J.P., and F. Ronquist. 2001. MRBAYES: Bayesian
inference of phylogeny. Bioinformatics 17:754-755.</li>


<li>Ronquist, F., and J.P. Huelsenbeck. 2003. MRBAYES 3: Bayesian
phylogenetic inference under mixed models. Bioinformatics
19:1572-1574.</li>


<li>Ronquist, F., M. Teslenko, P. van der Mark, D.L. Ayres, A. Darling,
S. HÃ¶hna, B. Larget, L. Liu, M.A. Suchard, and J.P. Huelsenbeck. 2012.
MRBAYES 3.2: Efficient Bayesian phylogenetic inference and model
selection across a large model space. Syst. Biol. 61:539-542.</li>
</ul>
If you use the parallel abilities of the program, you may also want to
cite:

<ul>
<li>Altekar, G., S. Dwarkadas, J. P. Huelsenbeck, and F. Ronquist.
2004. Parallel Metropolis-coupled Markov chain Monte Carlo for Bayesian
phylogenetic inference. Bioinformatics 20:407-415.</li>
</ul>
If you use the BEAGLE library, the appropriate citation is:

<ul>
<li>Ayres, D.L., A. Darling, D.J. Zwickl, P. Beerli, M.T. Holder, P.O.
Lewis, J.P. Huelsenbeck, F. Ronquist, D. L. Swofford, M. P. Cummings,
A. Rambaut, and M. A. Suchard. 2012. BEAGLE: an application programming
interface for statistical phylogenetics. Syst. Biol. 61:170-173.</li>
</ul>
You may also see further citations for substitution models,
computational methods implemented, etc, by issuing the
<kbd>citations</kbd> command in MrBayes.
