  <h2>Download MrBayes</h2>

  <p>MrBayes may be downloaded as a pre-compiled executable or in
  source form (recommended).</p>

  <h3>Current release</h3>

  <p>The most recent release version of MrBayes is <a href=
  "https://github.com/NBISweden/MrBayes/tree/v3.2.7a">3.2.7a</a>,
  released March 6, 2019.</p>

  <p>The 3.2.7a <a href=
  "https://github.com/NBISweden/MrBayes/archive/v3.2.7a.tar.gz">source
  code</a> is available for compilation on Unix machines.</p>

  <p>Pre-compiled (provisional) executables are available for Windows
  (<a href="https://github.com/NBISweden/MrBayes/releases/download/v3.2.7/MrBayes-3.2.7-WIN.zip">MrBayes-3.2.7-WIN.zip</a>).
  These are, however, serial versions compiled without the <a
  href="https://github.com/beagle-dev/beagle-lib">Beagle</a> library.
  The serial version works well for smaller analyses but if you plan to
  run large analyses using many parallel chains, you should use the MPI
  version instead.  Refer to the <a href= "manual.html">User Manual</a>,
  and the <a href="https://github.com/NBISweden/MrBayes/blob/develop/INSTALL">INSTALL</a>
  document on GitHub for help with installation of the program.</p>

  <p>MrBayes may also be installed through the Homebrew package manager
  on macOS, Linux, and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).  Please see the
  <a href="https://github.com/NBISweden/MrBayes/blob/develop/INSTALL">INSTALL</a>
  document for instructions.</p>
