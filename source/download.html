  <h3>Current release</h3>

  <p>The next release of MrBayes is currently in preparation (autumn 2018)
  (see <b>Developer version</b> below). Meanwhile, the current
  release version of MrBayes is <a href=
  "https://github.com/NBISweden/MrBayes/tree/v3.2.6">3.2.6</a>, released
  November 25, 2015. Pre-compiled executables, as well as the release
  source may be found on GitHub. You can download executable versions
  for <a href=
  "https://github.com/NBISweden/MrBayes/releases/download/v3.2.6/MrBayes-3.2.6_WIN32_x64.zip">
  Windows (32-bit and 64-bit)</a>, and <a href=
  "https://github.com/NBISweden/MrBayes/releases/download/v3.2.6/MrBayes-3.2.6_MACx64.zip">
  Macintosh (64bit)</a> computers, as well as the <a href=
  "https://github.com/NBISweden/MrBayes/archive/v3.2.6.tar.gz">source
  code</a> for compilation on Unix machines. The Mac installer includes
  both the serial and parallel (MPI) version of the program, while the
  Windows installer only includes the serial version; both include the
  BEAGLE library (v2.1). The serial version works well for smaller
  analyses but if you plan to run large analyses using many parallel
  chains, you should use the MPI version instead. Refer to the <a href=
  "manual.html">User Manual</a> for help with
  installation of the program.</p>
