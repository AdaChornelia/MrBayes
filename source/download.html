  <h3>Current release</h3>

  The most recent release version of MrBayes is <a href=
  "https://github.com/NBISweden/MrBayes/tree/v3.2.7">3.2.7</a>,
  released February 13, 2019. Pre-compiled executables are <em>not
  yet available</em> for this release, but the release source code
  may be found on GitHub. You can download executable versions of the
  <em>previous</em> release for
  <a href=
  "https://github.com/NBISweden/MrBayes/releases/download/v3.2.6/MrBayes-3.2.6_WIN32_x64.zip">
  Windows (32-bit and 64-bit)</a>, and <a href=

  Macintosh (64-bit)</a> computers.

  <p>The macOS installer includes both the serial and parallel (MPI)
  version of the program, while the Windows installer only includes the
  serial version; both include the BEAGLE library (v2.1). The serial
  version works well for smaller analyses but if you plan to run large
  analyses using many parallel chains, you should use the MPI version
  instead. Refer to the <a href= "manual.html">User Manual</a> for help
  with installation of the program.</p>
