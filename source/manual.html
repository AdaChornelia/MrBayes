  <h2>Manual and Other Resources</h2>

  <h3>Manual</h3>

  <p>A good resource for new users is the MrBayes 3.2 manual, which
  contains instructions for downloading and installing the program, two
  tutorials including a qick-start version, discussions of all the
  models implemented in the program, answers to some frequently asked
  questions, a list of the differences between versions 2 and 3 of the
  program, instructions for compiling and running the parallel version
  of the program, and tips for users who want to tweak the source code
  or contribute bug fixes or new functionality. In an appendix, there
  is a diagrammatic summary of all the models implemented in the
  program and most of the proposal mechanisms. You can download the
  manual (pdf) <a href="./assets/mb3.2_manual.pdf">here</a>.</p>

  <h3>Online Help</h3>

  <p>MrBayes 3 provides extensive online help through the <kbd>help</kbd>
  command. Simply type <kbd>help</kbd> at the command prompt to get a list of
  the available commands. Type <kbd>help &lt;command&gt;</kbd> to get help
  information for a specific command. For instance, <kbd>help lset</kbd> will
  give you the help information for the <kbd>lset</kbd> command, including a
  discussion of all the available parameters and options. The help
  information for a command typically also includes a summary table of
  the options and current settings.</p>

  <h3>Command Reference</h3>

  <p>You can produce a text file containing all the help information
  for the current version of the program by using the <kbd>manual</kbd> command
  in MrBayes. If you produce this file immediately after starting the
  program, the text file will contain all the default settings and can
  be used as a command reference.</p>

  <h3>General Advice</h3>

  <p>Remember that MrBayes is free software and that it currently has
  thousands of users around the world. Therefore, the authors have
  no possibility to provide extensive user help. Please first read
  the manual and the command reference carefully to make sure the
  problem you are having is not addressed there.  If the problem you are
  having seems to be a bug in the program, report it as described <a
