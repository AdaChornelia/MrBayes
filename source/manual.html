  <h2>Manual and Other Resources</h2>

  <h3>Manual</h3>

  <p>A good resource for new users is the MrBayes 3.2 manual, which
  contains instructions for downloading and installing the program, two
  tutorials including a qick-start version, discussions of all the
  models implemented in the program, answers to some frequently asked
  questions, a list of the differences between versions 2 and 3 of the
  program, instructions for compiling and running the parallel version
  of the program, and tips for users who want to tweak the source code
  or contribute bug fixes or new functionality. In an appendix, there
  is a diagrammatic summary of all the models implemented in the
  program and most of the proposal mechanisms. You can download the
  manual (pdf) <a href="./assets/mb3.2_manual.pdf">here</a>.</p>

  <h3>Online Help</h3>

  <p>MrBayes 3 provides extensive online help through the 'help'
  command. Simply type 'help' at the command prompt to get a list of
  the available commands. Type 'help &lt;command&gt;' to get help
  information for a specific command. For instance, 'help lset' will
  give you the help information for the 'lset' command, including a
  discussion of all the available parameters and options. The help
  information for a command typically also includes a summary table of
  the options and current settings.</p>

  <h3>Command Reference</h3>

  <p>You can produce a text file containing all the help information
  for the current version of the program by using the 'manual' command
  in MrBayes. If you produce this file immediately after starting the
  program, the text file will contain all the default settings and can
  be used as a command reference. If you prefer not to produce this
  file yourself, you can download a pdf copy <a href=
  "./assets/commref_mbpre-3.2.7.pdf">here</a>.</p>

  <h3>E-mail List</h3>

  <p>Finally, a good resource for resolving problems with MrBayes is
  the MrBayes <a href=
  "https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/mrbayes-users">mailing
  list</a>. You can ask a question about MrBayes by simply posting a
  message to this list. Before you can send a message to the list,
  however, you need to subscribe to it as explained on the home page of
  the mailing list (see the link above). The <a href=
  "https://sourceforge.net/p/mrbayes/mailman/mrbayes-users/">archive</a>
  is accessible to everyone.</p>

  <h3>General Advice</h3>

  <p>Remember that MrBayes is free software and that it currently has
  thousands of users around the world. Therefore, there is no
  possibility for the authors to provide extensive user help. Please
  first read the manual and the command reference carefully to make
  sure the problem you are having is not addressed there. If this does
  not help, try using the MrBayes email list to pose your question. If
  the problem you are having seems to be a bug in the program, report
  it using the bug reporting tool provided on SourceForge, as described
  <a href="issues.html">here</a>. If you have general questions about
  the MrBayes project, the models and MCMC sampling algorithms
  implemented in the program, or the future development of the
  project, you are welcome to email
  the <a href="authors.html">authors</a> directly.</p>
