<h2>Reporting a Bug</h2>


<p><em>NOTE:</em> Bug reporting is being moved over from SourceForge to
GitHub. This move is on ongoing project. This means that the info on
this page regarding the SourceForge bug tracker is out of date. It will
be updated when the old bug tickets have been migrated to GitHub
issues</p>


<p>The best way to report a bug is with the <a href=
"https://sourceforge.net/p/mrbayes/bugs/">bug report tool</a> on the
MrBayes Sourceforge project page. With this tool one can look at
previously reported bugs. Here you can chose different filters to
select only those bug reports that satisfy you search criteria. If the
problem you have encountered is not listed here, you can submit a new
bugreport by clicking the <a href=
"https://sourceforge.net/p/mrbayes/bugs/new/">Create Ticket</a>
link.</p>


<h3>Submit a new bug</h3>


<p>On the bug report page there are a few optional choices:</p>


<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Category</em>: Where did the bug appear, e.g. in the MPI
part.</p>
</li>


<li>
<p><em>Group</em>: In which version of MrBayes did the bug appear, e.g.
version 3.2 or earliar. Note however that we discontinue fixing bugs
for versions earlier than 3.2 (3.1 or earlier). The bug report about
version before 3.2 is only useful as information to other users
outlining the bug. If you have problems with version before 3.2, please
try MrBayes 3.2 and if the problem persist, report it as a bug of
version 3.2.</p>
</li>


<li>
<p><em>Private</em>: is a visibility flag. When it marked your post
will be visible only to administrators (developers of Mrbayes) and not
to the general public.</p>
</li>
</ul>


<p>In the mandatory fields <em>Summary</em> and <em>Description</em>
you can describe the bug. Keep in mind that the <b>only</b> way for us
to solve the bug is if <b>we can repeat it</b>. See for example, the
article <a href=
"http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html">How to Report
Bugs Effectively</a>.</p>


<p>The bug tool allows you to attach files to your bug report. You can
find this upload option at the end of the report page.</p>


<p>We would very much appreciate if you can send us nexus file which on
its execution courses the problem that you describe in your bug report.
Nexus file much like a picture may worth thousands of words. Please
specify after how many generation you encountered the problem if it is
applicable. It would be even more kind of you if you could provide a
log file containing the whole output of the run. If resulting log file
is too big you can cat out routine printout of likelihood, leaving the
beginning of the run where analyze is set up and the final (crash)
messages. If you have multiple files to send you should pack them first
into one by tar, zip or any other commonly used compression
program.</p>


<p>If instead of using release version of MrBayes you are using
development version from the trunk, then please specify which release
you are using. The release number is printed after latter 'r' on the
first line printed by MrBayes when it started. The first line may look
like this 'MrBayes v3.2-svn(r456)', which means that you have release
number 456. Also if you compiled MrBayes with non-default options then
please let us know what they were.</p>


<p>Later versions (&gt;3.2.6 only) of MrBayes have an extended
"Version" command that displays not only the version of the software,
but also what features it was compiled with, what type of host the
software was compiled for, as well as the vendor and version of the
compiler that was used. This information would be useful in any bug
report.</p>


<p>When you are satisfied with your report, you can submit it by
pressing the <em>Save</em> button. Although Sourceforge asks you to
login, you don't have to. The bug report will then be filled
anonymously, but you might want to add your e-mail address in the
report, so we can contact you if further details are needed.</p>


<h2>Mailing list</h2>


<p>A great aid for resolving problems with MrBayes is the MrBayes
<a href=
"https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/mrbayes-users">mailing
list</a>. If you have a general question about MrBayes you can ask it
by posting the question to the mailing list. To post on this list you
have to be subscribed to it. The <a href=
"https://sourceforge.net/p/mrbayes/mailman/mrbayes-users/">list
archive</a> is accessible for everyone.</p>
